# NLP Project

***It is a project carried out by Pablo Sánchez Cabrera that aims to answer a series of questions
about the behavior of American politicians and senators on social networks.***

During this project, a prediction of the sentiment of the tweets as well as their theme has been made.
To do this, the Huggig Face platform has been used. 
Thus, two types of Transformers architectures designed specifically for both task will be considered.

In the case of topic prediction, a Zero-Shot architecture has been used; 
which is a type of algorithm that allows learning classes that have not previously been seen.
Below is a graphic representation of this type of architecture

## Output

The results of the studies carried out can be seen in the `development` file in the `notebooks` folder.

# Features

Throughout this project, different tasks have been carried out:

### Graphs

Barplot and histogram

### Preprocessing

Removing characters (@, RT, #, etc.) including suppression of stop-words or lemmatization of the text.

### Machine Learning model

Development of a system for predicting the theme and sentiment of the comments 
made by different politicians on social networks.
