# NLP Project

***It is a project carried out by Pablo Sánchez Cabrera that aims to answer a series of questions
about the behavior of American politicians and senators on social networks.***

During this project, a prediction of the sentiment of the tweets as well as their theme has been made.
To do this, the Huggig Face platform has been used. 
Thus, two types of Transformers architectures designed specifically for this have been used.

In the case of topic prediction, a Zero-Shot architecture has been used; 
which is a type of algorithm that allows learning classes that have not previously been seen.
Below is a graphic representation of this type of architecture

## How to set up the environment
